  <h2>Suicide Around the World (1985-2016)</h2>
  <p>Suicide is a complex and sensitive public health issue characterized by individuals taking their own lives intentionally. It is a global problem with significant social, psychological, and economic implications. Factors contributing to suicide risk include mental health disorders, substance abuse, socioeconomic stressors, and access to means. Prevention efforts often involve mental health support, crisis helplines, awareness campaigns, and restricting access to lethal methods. Addressing suicide requires a multifaceted approach that combines medical, psychological, and societal interventions to reduce its prevalence and provide support to those at risk.</p>
